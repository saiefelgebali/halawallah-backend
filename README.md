# Hala Wallah Backend

This is the repository for the backend application of the **Hala** project.

Go to [frontend](https://github.com/saiefelgebali/halawallah-frontend).

## About This Project
Hala is a mentally, emotionally, and physically sustainable platform, designed to connect friends and family, with no ulterior motive. 

I created Hala as an alternative option for those who seek to rid themselves of their addiction to other platforms. 

Excessive use of social media has been proven to cause feelings of depression and anxiety.
This project aims to create a social platform without the features that are known to cause mental health problems. 

Hala fixes some of these problems by
- Omitting user likes
- Hiding follower counts
- No Advertisments
- Blocking NSFW content

This project is an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) entry.
